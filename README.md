## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this challenge I learned mainly about CSS grid, the "grid-auto-flow" property was really helpful.
In javascript, i came to fully understand the "setTimeOut" function

```css
.brands {
    grid-auto-flow: column;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
```
```js
 setTimeout(() => {
        modal.style.opacity = 0
        modal.style.visibility = 'hidden';
    }, 600)
```



### Continued development

CSS grid is my main priority right now, I continuously tries to improve my skills in it
